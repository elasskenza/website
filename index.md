 I am a **Post-doctoral researcher** in economics at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home) and the [Axa Gender Lab](https://genderlab.unibocconi.eu/)

* My research interests are in **applied labour**, **gender**, **digital** and **urban economics**.
* A key aspect of my research is the use of **text analysis methods** to collect new data.

* My ongoing projects focus on spatial disparities in gender wage gaps, gender differences in the **job search** and stereotypes linked to skills and **artificial intelligence**. 
   
*  Before, I was a **PhD candidate** in economics at the [Aix Marseille School of Economics](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en/members/elass) (AMSE) and at the [Labour Chair](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/programme-partenarial/chaires/chaire-travail/) at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/programme-partenarial/chaires/chaire-travail/doctorants/)

* In 2019, I started my PhD on the <i>supply side effects on gender wage inequality</i>, supervised by [Cecilia Garcia-Peñalosa](https://sites.google.com/view/ceciliagarciapenalosa) and [Christian Schluter](https://christianschluter.github.io/). I defended my thesis in October 2023.

* I am also on [X](https://twitter.com/ElassKenza) and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/kenza-elass.bsky.social).
