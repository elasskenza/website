 I am a **Post-doctoral researcher** in economics at [ENS de Lyon]([https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/](https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/)), in the Department of Economics and the Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict (CERGIC) and an affiliate of [Bocconi's Gender Lab](https://genderlab.unibocconi.eu/).

* My research interests are in **applied labour**, **gender**, **digital** and **urban economics**.
  
* A key aspect of my research is the use of **text analysis methods (NLP)** to collect new data, like CVs, job descriptions, and job vacancies.

* My ongoing projects focus on spatial disparities in gender wage gaps, gender differences in the **job search** and **generative artificial intelligence** algorithmic bias.
  
* In 2023, I have received funding from the **[Future Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)](https://fondazione-fair.it/en/)** foundation to develop my research agenda at Bocconi University on **Gender Bias in Generative Artificial Intelligence**, in collaboration with [Paola Profeta](https://sites.google.com/view/paola-profeta). This research agenda is further supported by the <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/women-and-science">Women and Science</a> Chair (Dauphine-PSL) Grant.
   
*  Before, I was a **PhD candidate** in economics at the [Aix Marseille School of Economics](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en/members/elass) (AMSE) and at the **[Labour Chair](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/programme-partenarial/chaires/chaire-travail/)** at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/programme-partenarial/chaires/chaire-travail/doctorants/)

* In 2019, I started my PhD on the <i>supply side effects on gender wage inequality</i>, supervised by [Cecilia Garcia-Pe√±alosa](https://sites.google.com/view/ceciliagarciapenalosa) and [Christian Schluter](https://christianschluter.github.io/). I defended my thesis in October 2023.

* I am also on [X](https://twitter.com/ElassKenza) and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/kenza-elass.bsky.social).
