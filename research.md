### *[Male and female selection effects on gender wage gaps in three countries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537124000022)*

##### Published at Labour Economics  - [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2024.102506](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2024.102506)

  * **Abstract:** A vast literature on gender wage gaps has examined the importance of selection into employment. However, most analyses have focused only on female labour force participation and gaps at the median. The Great Recession questions this approach because of the major shift in male employment that it implied. This paper uses the methodology proposed by Arellano and Bonhomme (2017) to estimate a quantile selection model over the period 2007–2018. Using a tax and benefit microsimulation model, I compute an instrument capturing both male and female decisions to participate in the labour market: the potential out-of-work income. Since my instrument is crucially determined by the welfare state, I consider three countries with notably different benefit systems – the UK, France and Finland. My results imply different selection patterns across countries and a sizeable male selection in France and the UK. Correction for selection bias lowers the gender wage gap and reveals a substantial glass ceiling with different magnitudes. Findings suggest that disparities between these countries are driven by occupational segregation and public spending on families.

### *What do women want in a job? Household constraints, gender-biased decisions and the reservation wage gap*

#### Draft available upon request 

  * **Abstract:** Recent explanations of the gender wage gap emphasize the role of gender differences in job search, yet the underlying origins of these disparities remain largely unexplored. This paper assesses the role of gender-specific decisions and household constraints in the reservation wage gap during the job search using French administrative data from employment services. First, I assess which kind of occupations men and women apply for and the gap in their reservation
wages. Employing text analysis, I build a novel dataset classifying occupations with respect to a number of characteristics and examine to which extent men and women differ in the occupation they are looking for. Quantile decomposition methods allow me to document an unequal gap in reservation wage, intensifying along the distribution, and explained by gender-biased choices. Then, I assess how the preferences in temporal flexibility and the reservation wage are impacted following a reform in October 2018 which increased the childcare benefits of single-parent households by 30%. Using a triple difference-in-difference strategy and the spatial exposure in childcare services availability, the findings indicate that the reduction in childcare costs led women to decrease their reservation wage and increase their likelihood to target occupations requiring greater temporal flexibility as well as their labour supply after a long career break.

### *Gender gaps in the urban wage premium*
 With Cecilia García-Peñalosa (AMSE, CNRS, EHESS) & Christian Schluter (AMSE)

  * **Abstract:** In France, the gender wage gap for the 20% of the workforce living in the densest locations is 22% lower than that for those living in the bottom 20% of the density distribution, indicating that women benefit more from urban density than men. This paper explores the importance of geographical location for understanding the gender wage gap. Following the recent literature on economic geography that takes into account the endogeneity of location, we estimate the difference in the returns to urban density across genders. We build an exhaustive matched employer-employee panel database based on administrative data that allows us to follow almost all French workers during the period 2005-2019. Our results show that earnings increase with density for both men and women, with a significantly higher urban wage premium for women, which is about 55\% larger than for men. We consider different mechanisms that may explain this pattern, such as the difference in returns to experience, access to childcare facilities and the structure of the local labour market. Our findings suggest that these factors explain all of the gender gap in earnings from living in denser areas.

### *Generative AI & Labor Market Discrimination*

  * **Abstract:** With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) -- such as OpenAI's ChatGPT -- there has been a proliferation of websites offering CV generation services for job seekers, and CV screening services for employers. We study the use of LLMs to produce and screen CVs of job applicants. We run a series of online experiments inspired by classical correspondence studies. Three main findings emerge. First, leading open-source and closed-source models typically produce gender-stereotyped CVs. Second, they discriminate against women. Third, consistent with theories of systemic discrimination, the bias against women increases if the models are used to produce and screen applicant packages.
